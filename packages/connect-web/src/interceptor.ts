/**
 * An interceptor can add logic to clients, similar to the decorators
 * or middleware you may have seen in other libraries. Interceptors may
 * mutate the request and response, catch errors and retry/recover, emit
 * logs, or do nearly everything else.
 *
 * For a simple example, the following interceptor logs all requests:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const logger: Interceptor = (next) => async (req) => {
 *   console.log(`sending message to ${req.url}`);
 *   return await next(req);
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * You can think of interceptors like a layered onion. A request initiated
 * by a client goes through the outermost layer first. In the center, the
 * actual HTTP request is run by the transport. The response then comes back
 * through all layers and is returned to the client.
 *
 * To implement that layering, Interceptors are functions that wrap a call
 * invocation. In an array of interceptors, the interceptor at the end of
 * the array is applied first.
