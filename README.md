# Connect-Web

Connect-Web is a simple library to call remote procedures from a web browser. 
Unlike REST, you get a type-safe client and never have to think about
serialization again.

The procedures are defined in a [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
schema implemented by your backend, and Connect-Web generates the clients and
related types to access the backend. The clients support two protocols:
gRPC-web, and Connect's own protocol.

The [Connect protocol](https://connect.build/docs/protocol/) is a simple,
POST-only protocol that works over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. It supports
server-streaming methods just like gRPC-Web, but is easy to debug in the
network inspector. Calling a Connect API is easy enough just with the fetch
API. Try it with our live demo:

```ts
const res = await fetch("https://demo.connect.build/buf.connect.demo.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"content-type": "application/json"},
  body: `{"sentence": "I feel happy."}`
});
const answer = await res.json();
console.log(answer);
// {sentence: 'When you feel happy, what do you do?'}
```

Using the client generated by Connect-Web, the same call becomes quite a bit 
simpler:

```ts
const answer = await eliza.say({sentence: "I feel happy."});
console.log(answer);
// {sentence: 'When you feel happy, what do you do?'}
```

To get started, head over to the [docs](https://connect.build/docs/web/getting-started)
for a tutorial. You will also find API documentation and best practices there.
For using connect-web with your favorite framework, take a look at 
[connect-web-integration](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-web-integration).


## Supported Browsers

Connect-Web supports all modern web browsers that implement the widely
available [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
and the [Encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API).
The library and the generated code are compatible with ES2017 and TypeScript 4.1.


## Connect for Node.js (Preview)

With [@bufbuild/connect-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/connect-node), 
you have the option to use the same clients from Connect-Web on Node.js v18. You can 
also use it for servers using the Node.js `http`, `https`, or `http2` modules. 

Connect-Node is still in preview, so we want your feedback! We’d love to learn about
your use cases and what you’d like to do with Connect-Node. For example, do you plan
to use it with React, Remix, or on the edge with Vercel’s Edge Runtime? You can reach
us either through the [Buf Slack](https://buf.build/links/slack/) or by filing a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-web/issues) and we’d be more than
happy to chat!
